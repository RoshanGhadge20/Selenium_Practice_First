An automation framework in the context of software testing is a structured set of guidelines, tools, 
and practices designed to make the process of automated testing more efficient, consistent, and 
reliable. It provides a foundation that facilitates the creation, execution, and management of automated
test scripts. Here are the key concepts and components of an automation framework

Components of an Automation Framework

Test Script Repository: A structured directory or repository where all test scripts are stored and managed.

Libraries and Utilities: Reusable functions, classes, and methods that perform common actions like logging, exception handling, and data manipulation.

Test Data Management: Mechanisms for managing and accessing test data, which can be stored in files, databases, or other data sources.

Configuration Files: Files that contain configuration settings for the test environment, such as URLs, database connections, and environment-specific variables.

Test Execution Engine: The core component that drives the execution of test scripts, handles scheduling, and manages test execution flow.

Reporting and Logging: Tools and mechanisms for generating detailed test execution reports and logs, which help in analyzing test results and diagnosing issues.

Integration with CI/CD: Integration with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to enable automated test execution as part of the build and deployment process.

1. Create a Maven Project 
2. In pom.xml file update all the required dependencies & plugins for project
3. Use page object modal design pattern where all the (Xpaths & functions are kept in one single file ) & The Actual code of execution contains in another file 
4. Make implementation of Waits, Actions Class, & more over in general manner 
5. Create an abstract component for the common/reusable of utilities 
6. Instead of using the implicit wait mechanism use explicit wait mechanism for the better speedy of execution
7. Create a common methods & abstract component that extends to child classes 
8. Create a configuration file ( globalData.properties ) which contains an basic of properties to be needed while execution of program code 
9. Create a utility file that contains/read all the data from the json file & used it into the program code ( Jackson databind)
10. Create a take screenshot/Extend Reports  utilities into the base class.
11. Resolved all the concurrency problems while execution of program code
12. Add iRetryAnalyzer into the framework so that an all the flaky failed test cases are going to be executed again 
13. Add Maven implementation into the project so that execution can be done through the command line utilities 
14. Configure Jenkins (CI/CD) with the project implementation ss

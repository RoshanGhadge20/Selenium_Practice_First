Data-driven and keyword-driven testing are two popular approaches in automated testing frameworks. Here are the major differences between them:

Data-Driven Testing
Definition: Data-driven testing involves running the same set of test scripts multiple times with different sets of input data.

Key Characteristics:

Test Data Externalization: Test data is stored separately from the test scripts, often in external files like Excel, CSV, XML, or databases.
Reusability: The same test script can be reused with different data sets, reducing the need for writing multiple test cases.
Parameterization: Test scripts are parameterized to accept different inputs, enabling them to handle a variety of test scenarios.
Focus: Primarily focuses on validating the same functionality with multiple data sets.
Advantages:

Efficiency: Reduces redundancy by allowing a single script to cover multiple scenarios.
Maintenance: Easier to maintain as changes in test data do not require changes in the test scripts.
Scalability: Adding new test cases is as simple as adding new data sets.
Example:

java
Copy code
public class DataDrivenTest {
    @Test(dataProvider = "userData")
    public void testLogin(String username, String password) {
        // Steps to perform login
    }

    @DataProvider(name = "userData")
    public Object[][] getData() {
        return new Object[][] {
            {"user1", "pass1"},
            {"user2", "pass2"},
            {"user3", "pass3"}
        };
    }
}

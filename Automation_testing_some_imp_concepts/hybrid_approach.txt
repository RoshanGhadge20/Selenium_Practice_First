A hybrid framework is an approach that can be used to combine elements of both the keyword and data-driven framework. In this framework, 
test scripts are designed modularly. Each module is capable of functioning independently of the others.

Structure of a Hybrid Framework
Test Data:
Stored in external files like Excel, CSV, or databases.
Managed by utility classes that handle reading and writing operations.

Keywords:
Defined in external files like Excel or property files.
Implemented in a way that maps keywords to methods in code.

Page Objects:
Classes that represent web pages, containing locators and methods for interacting with web elements.

Test Scripts:
Use a combination of data-driven and keyword-driven approaches.
Call methods from page objects and utility classes.

Utilities:
Classes that provide common functionality like logging, reporting, and file handling.

Configuration:
Property files or XML files that store configuration details like browser settings, environment details, etc.

Keyword-Driven Testing
Definition: Keyword-driven testing involves creating test cases using a set of predefined keywords, which represent high-level actions or operations.

Key Characteristics:

Keyword Abstraction: Test scripts are written using keywords, each representing a specific action or method. These keywords are then mapped to the underlying code that performs the action.
Non-Technical Users: Allows non-technical users to create and understand test cases without needing to write code, as they can simply use the predefined keywords.
Modularity: High level of abstraction and modularity, as each keyword can be reused across multiple test cases.
Advantages:

Ease of Use: Non-technical stakeholders can write and understand test cases.
Readability: Test cases are more readable and easier to understand, as they use plain language keywords.
Maintenance: Changes in the application under test can often be managed by updating the keywords rather than all test cases.
Example:

java
Copy code
public class KeywordDrivenTest {
    public void performAction(String keyword, String... params) {
        switch (keyword) {
            case "openBrowser":
                openBrowser(params[0]);
                break;
            case "navigateTo":
                navigateTo(params[0]);
                break;
            case "click":
                click(params[0]);
                break;
            case "enterText":
                enterText(params[0], params[1]);
                break;
            // More keywords...
        }
    }

    public void openBrowser(String browserType) {
        // Implementation
    }

    public void navigateTo(String url) {
        // Implementation
    }

    public void click(String element) {
        // Implementation
    }

    public void enterText(String element, String text) {
        // Implementation
    }
}
